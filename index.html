<h3> Our Mission </h3>
<p> San Joaquin Valley Town Hall is a non-profit organization that is run by an all-volunteer board of directors. Our mission is to bring nationally and internattionaly renowned, thought-provoking speakers who inform, educate, and  entertain our audience! As one of our members told us:                                                          "Each year I give a ticket package to each of our family members. I think of it as the gift of knowledge and that is priceless."</p>
